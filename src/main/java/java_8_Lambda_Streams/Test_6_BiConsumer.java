     *  BiConsumer interface is the extension of the Consumer interface.
     *
     *  The BiConsumer interface is an extension of the Consumer interface in Java,
     *  and it's used when you need to perform an operation that takes two input arguments and doesn't return any result.
     *
     *  The "Bi" in BiConsumer stands for "binary," indicating that it deals with two inputs.
     *
     *  The primary difference between Consumer and BiConsumer is the number of input arguments they accept:
     *
     * Consumer<T>: Accepts a single input of type T.
     * BiConsumer<T, U>: Accepts two inputs of types T and U.
     *
     * The BiConsumer interface is part of the java.util.function package and is often used in scenarios where
     * you need to perform some operation that involves two input parameters,
     * such as updating two values in a map, performing actions on pairs of elements, or applying operations on pairs of arguments.
